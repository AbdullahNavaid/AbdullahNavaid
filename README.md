# About Me

Hello, I'm **Abdullah Navaid**, a Computer Science student at **University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)**. My passion for programming started with Python, and since then, I’ve been fascinated by problem-solving and creating efficient solutions. Whether it's building small scripts or working on larger-scale projects, my focus has always been on continuous learning and improvement.

## Timeline

- **Education**: Currently studying core computer science topics such as algorithms, data structures, and systems programming. These subjects have formed the basis of my problem-solving skills and shaped my growth as a software engineer.

- **Projects**: Some of the projects I’ve worked on include:
    - **TensorFlow Object Tracker**: Building a real-time object detection system using TensorFlow, which tracks and identifies objects through a camera feed.
    - **Chess Game Integrated AI Engine**: Developing an AI-powered chess engine that analyzes games, makes moves, and provides strategic insights.

- **Skills**: I have experience with Python, C++, SQL, and have honed my expertise in debugging, memory management, and algorithm optimization.

## Future Goals

I am eager to explore areas such as **AI**, **machine learning**, and **systems programming**. My goal is to apply my knowledge to real-world projects, collaborate with innovative teams, and continue developing applications that make a meaningful impact.

## Soft Skills

Collaboration and communication are key to my work ethic. Through group projects, I've learned how to effectively engage with diverse teams, resolve challenges, and deliver successful results.
